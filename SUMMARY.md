**Fluorescent Neuronal Cells** is a dataset for semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the biological research. 

The dataset consists of 283 images with 5533 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*stained neuron*).

Images in the Fluorescent Neuronal Cells dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 50 (18% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021 by the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en).
