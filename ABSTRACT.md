The authors of the **Fluorescent Neuronal Cells** dataset address the laborious and time-consuming task of cell counting in fluorescent microscopy. While these objects are generally distinguishable, manual annotation can be prone to errors due to fatigue and subjective interpretation of borderline cases.

The Fluorescent Neuronal Cells dataset comprises 283 high-resolution images (1600 Ã— 1200 pixels) of mice brain slices along with corresponding ground-truth labels. The experiments involved injecting a retrograde tracer (Cholera Toxin b, CTb) into specific brain structures of mice, highlighting neurons connected to the injection site. Fluorescence microscopy captured the neurons of interest as yellow-ish spots with varying brightness and saturation against a composite background.

Despite efforts to stabilize the acquisition process, the images present challenges due to variability in brightness, contrast, and saturation. The fluid nature of cell structures further complicates detection, as their shapes change significantly. Artifacts, biological structures like neurons' filaments, and non-marked cells resembling stained ones also hinder recognition. Additionally, the number of target cells varies widely across images, necessitating high precision or recall depending on the density.

In the training phase, ground-truth labels serve as examples for the model to learn from. Binary masks are used for image segmentation, where objects and background are represented by white and black pixels, respectively.

To expedite labeling, an automatic procedure was employed. Gaussian blurring and thresholding were applied to identify potential cell candidates. Operators then reviewed results to remove false positives, and domain experts manually segmented remaining images. The dataset includes challenging examples with artifacts and crowded objects.

While Deep Learning is prominent in computer vision, the lack of annotated data hampers applications involving non-standard pictures. Models pre-trained on natural image datasets may not suit extraneous domains. By releasing their dataset and pre-trained model, the authors aim to accelerate biomedical imaging advancements and spur research on data analysis techniques for fluorescence microscopy and related domains.
